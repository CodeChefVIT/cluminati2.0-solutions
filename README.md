### **Clueminati 2.0**

**Clueminati 2.0** was the second iteration of a campus-wide treasure hunt contest organized by **CodeChef VIT** as part of **graVITas'24**. Gravitas is renowned for its immersive events, workshops, and challenges that bring together tech enthusiasts and innovators. In line with this spirit, Clueminati 2.0 provided a thrilling experience where groups of participants were divided into inside and outside teams. The inside team solved cryptic clues and followed the storyline, utilizing all the resources at hand to aid the outside team. Meanwhile, the outside team braved VIT itself, traversing around the campus and solving the puzzles at each outside station that were set up.

This repository contains both the indoor storyline and the outside puzzles from Clueminati 2.0, arranged and made available to revisit and reminisce for those who had the opportunity to attend our event, and those who did not.
