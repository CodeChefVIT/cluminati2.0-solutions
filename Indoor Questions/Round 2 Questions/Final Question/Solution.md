# Solution

The final clue of Clueminati involved decoding a riddle whose answer is "gold." In the riddle, certain letters were capitalized. Decoding these letters led to the word **SPOTIFY**. By searching the hex value of gold on Spotify, a playlist appeared with the Clueminati icon. The first letters of each song in the playlist spelled out `CSHALL`, which served as a clue for the inside team to relay to the outside team to return to the CS Hall and receive the bonus points.
