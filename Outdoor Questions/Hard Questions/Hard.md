# Clueminati - Tough Questions

## Question 1

Beyond the crumbling towers of a forgotten world, where shadows whisper secrets long lost, lies a door no one dares to find. The key is not of metal, nor of time, but a word that was spoken before the first dawn. Decode the riddle and tell me, traveller, what opens the lock?

*It covers inch by inch. No!  
Tie ton to ground.  
Protect. Pretext.  
Or else a new order began.  
A more Roman age.  
Red Rowena be not proud.  
Draw Caesar, erase a coward,  
Find home, or harass selfless Sara.  
Bring forth the maps.  
DNA and Sam shall save us!  
Delia, here we nine were ailed.  
Here we suffered.  
Here we fought and boxed.  
Don't bob to nod,  
Just duck and weave.  
Estelle, the danger lurks,  
To be prepared, set a room.  
On no moor,  
Bates, will we be safe.  
In the battle of commerce, science, and aesthetic  
The lab's approach may yet prevail.  
No, it's opposed!  
Art sees trade's opposition.  
Together they triumph.  
Now sir, war is won.*

**Answer:** **Aibohphobia** (Fear of palindromes)

**Explanation:**

- The passage is filled with **palindromes**—phrases that read the same backward and forward.
  
- Examples of palindromic phrases in the text:

  - **"Tie ton to ground."**
  - **"Or else a new order began."**
  - **"A more Roman age."**
  - **"Red Rowena be not proud."**
  - **"Draw Caesar, erase a coward."**
  - **"Find home, or harass selfless Sara."**
  - **"Delia, here we nine were ailed."**
  - **"Don't bob to nod."**
  - **"On no moor."**
  - **"No, it's opposed!"**
  - **"Art sees trade's opposition."**
  - **"Now sir, war is won."**

- The recurring theme of palindromes suggests that the key to opening the lock is related to palindromes.

- **"Aibohphobia"** is a humorous term for the **fear of palindromes**—itself a palindrome.

- Therefore, the word to open the lock is **Aibohphobia**.

## Question 2

The soldier's hands trembled as water spilled across the keys. His urgent message fragmented into broken symbols, lost in static. Can you decode his warning before it's too late?

“**Yjr smdert yp yjod [ixx;r od yjr ms,e pg yjr v;in ejovj od pthsmodomh yjod rbrmy**”

**Answer:** **Codechef**

**Explanation:**

- The message appears garbled due to the keys being shifted.

- Each letter is **shifted one position to the right** on a QWERTY keyboard.

- To decode, shift each character **one key to the left** on the keyboard.

- **Decoding the message:**

  - **Y → T**
  - **J → H**
  - **R → E**
  - **S → A**
  - **M → N**
  - **D → S**
  - **E → W**
  - **[ → P**
  - **I → U**
  - **X → Z**
  - **; → L**
  - **' → ;** (punctuation may vary)
  - **O → I**
  - **P → O**
  - **G → F**
  - **V → C**
  - **; → L**
  - **N → B**

- Applying this to the entire message:

  ```
  Original: Yjr smdert yp yjod [ixx;r od yjr ms,e pg yjr v;in ejovj od pthsmodomh yjod rbrmy
  Decoded: The answer to this [puzzle] is the name of the main event of programming this year
  ```

- The main event of programming is **Codechef**.

- Therefore, the answer is **Codechef**.

## Question 3

In the dystopian ruins of a once-great city, a robot roams an 8×8 grid from its base at the bottom-left corner. An object lies hidden somewhere on this grid, detectable only when the robot occupies the same square. The robot’s mission is to locate this elusive object with the fewest moves possible, navigating through the chaos and uncertainty of its environment.

As the robot’s journey unfolds, it must rely on a strategy that minimizes its steps in a world fraught with danger and disarray. What search algorithm or technique should the robot employ to find the object efficiently, overcoming the desolation that surrounds it?

**Answer:** The robot should use the **Spiral Search** algorithm.

**Explanation:**

- **Spiral Search Technique:**
  
  - The robot starts at its initial position and moves in an expanding spiral pattern.
  
  - This method ensures that the robot covers all adjacent squares before moving outward, which is efficient if the object is nearby.
  
  - It reduces the total number of moves compared to linear or random searches.
  
- **Benefits:**

  - Systematic coverage of the grid.
  
  - Minimizes backtracking and redundant movements.
  
  - Efficient in terms of both time and energy, crucial in a resource-scarce dystopian world.

## Question 4

In a world shrouded in darkness and mystery, a message reads: **"Speak friend and enter."**

What word must you utter to gain entry and uncover what lies beyond the threshold?

**Answer:** **Mellon**

**Explanation:**

- This is a reference to **"The Lord of the Rings"** by J.R.R. Tolkien.

- At the **Doors of Durin** (the entrance to Moria), the inscription reads:

  - **"Speak, friend, and enter."**

- The solution is to speak the Elvish word for "friend," which is **"Mellon."**

- By saying **"Mellon,"** the doors open.

## Question 5

The next number holds the key, to set your captive allies free. In this broken world, one wrong guess and they’ll be lost in darkness' depths. Find the answer and set them free.

**1, 11, 12, 2111, 1321, __?**

**Answer:** **11213111**

**Explanation:**

- The sequence is generated by describing the previous number and then **reversing** it.

- **Process:**

  1. **1**  
     - Described as "One 1" → **11**  
     - Reversed: **11**

  2. **11**  
     - Described as "Two 1s" → **21**  
     - Reversed: **12**

  3. **12**  
     - Described as "One 1, One 2" → **1112**  
     - Reversed: **2111**

  4. **2111**  
     - Described as "One 2, Three 1s" → **1231**  
     - Reversed: **1321**

  5. **1321**  
     - Described as "One 1, One 3, One 2, One 1" → **11131211**  
     - Reversed: **11213111**

- **Next Number:** **11213111**

## Question 6

Your partner has infiltrated the enemy headquarters and has just 45 minutes to sift through their critical documents. As the sole link to the outside, you must keep a precise watch. The moment the 45 minutes are up, you need to alert him immediately. His success—and his safety—hinge on your ability to time it perfectly.

However, you only have two strings whose only property is that when you light one end of either string it takes exactly one hour to burn. The rate at which the strings will burn is completely random and each string is different. How do you measure 45 minutes?

**Answer:** Light one string at **both ends** and the second string at **one end**. When the first string burns out, **30 minutes** have passed. Then light the **other end** of the second string. When it burns out, **15 minutes** have passed, totaling **45 minutes**.

**Explanation:**

- **First String:**

  - Lighting both ends causes it to burn twice as fast.
  
  - It will burn completely in **30 minutes**.

- **Second String:**

  - Light one end at the start.
  
  - After **30 minutes** (when the first string burns out), it has **30 minutes** of burn time left.
  
  - Lighting the other end now causes it to burn the remaining length in **15 minutes**.

- **Total Time:**

  - **30 minutes** (first string burns out) + **15 minutes** (second string burns out) = **45 minutes**.

## Question 7

In a dystopian world where resources are scarce and every tool is precious, your leader has devised a clever solution to keep track of time. With just two dice, each marked with essential numbers, you can monitor the dates from **01 to 31**. What are these numbers?

**Answer:**

- **First Die:** 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- **Second Die:** 0, 1, 2, 6 (or 9), 7, 8

**Explanation:**

- By arranging these numbers, you can display any date from **01** to **31**.

- The **6** can be inverted to represent **9**.

- **Examples:**

  - **01:** Die 1 shows **0**, Die 2 shows **1**.
  
  - **31:** Die 1 shows **3**, Die 2 shows **1**.

- This setup covers all necessary combinations for dates.

## Question 8

The evil dictator has 1,000 wine bottles brought for a party. 24 hours before the party, he gets information that one of the 1,000 bottles is poisoned. When one ingests the poison, no effects are seen for 22 hours, and after 22 hours, they instantly drop dead. He has as many prisoners sentenced to death as he needs. How many **minimum prisoners** does he need to figure out which bottle is poisoned?

**Answer:** **10 prisoners**

**Explanation:**

- **Binary Representation:**

  - **2^10 = 1,024**, which is greater than 1,000.

- **Method:**

  - Label each bottle from **1 to 1,000**.

  - Convert each bottle number to a **10-digit binary number**.

  - Each prisoner represents a bit position (**1** to **10**).

- **Procedure:**

  - For each bottle, if a bit is **1** in its binary representation, the corresponding prisoner drinks from that bottle.

- **Outcome:**

  - After 22 hours, observe which prisoners die.

  - The combination of dead prisoners corresponds to the binary number of the poisoned bottle.

## Question 13

In a dystopian world where resources are scarce and survival hinges on precision, a man finds himself with three jugs of varying sizes: one that can hold **8 liters**, another that holds **5 liters**, and a third that holds **3 liters**. Water, the rarest of commodities, must be measured exactly to ensure his next meal can be prepared.

His task is to measure out exactly **4 liters** of water using only these three jugs. How can he achieve this with no other tools or means, knowing that even the smallest mistake could be fatal?

**Answer:**

1. **Fill the 5-liter jug** completely.

2. **Pour** from the 5-liter jug into the **3-liter jug** until it's full.

   - **5-liter jug:** 2 liters remain.

   - **3-liter jug:** Full (3 liters).

3. **Empty** the 3-liter jug.

4. **Pour** the **2 liters** from the 5-liter jug into the 3-liter jug.

   - **5-liter jug:** Empty.

   - **3-liter jug:** Contains 2 liters.

## Question 14

In a dystopian future, the government communicates secret orders through encrypted colors. The color codes are sent in RGB format, but the true meaning is hidden by shifting the values using a complex mathematical rule.

A rebel intercepts this message: **RGB(153, 76, 0)**. After applying a specific algorithm where each color value is **reversed using modulo 256** (i.e., subtracting each from 255), they can reveal the true message.

What is the true color, and how do you interpret its meaning in this world where different colors have special codes for actions?

**Answer:**

- **Calculate the true RGB values:**

  - **Red:** 255 - 153 = **102**

  - **Green:** 255 - 76 = **179**

  - **Blue:** 255 - 0 = **255**

- **True Color:** **RGB(102, 179, 255)**

- **Interpretation:**

  - This color is a shade of **light sky blue**.

  - In this dystopian world, **light blue** could symbolize **hope**, **freedom**, or a call to **resistance**.

  - The rebels interpret this as a message to **unite** and **take action**.

## Question 15

In a dystopian city, a leader must visit two refugee camps on opposite sides of a ravaged town. Every Sunday, the leader arrives at a decrepit subway station at a random time and boards the next train—one heading north to Camp Alpha or south to Camp Omega.

Despite the trains running every 20 minutes, Camp Omega receives aid only once every five Sundays. The leader insists they are following the plan exactly. Why does Camp Omega receive assistance so infrequently?

**Answer:**

- **Unequal Train Scheduling:**

  - The trains to Camp Alpha and Camp Omega run every 20 minutes but are **offset** by a few minutes.

- **Probability Factor:**

  - Since the leader arrives at a random time, they are more likely to catch the train to **Camp Alpha** due to longer intervals between trains to Camp Omega.

- **Explanation:**

  - For example, if trains to Camp Alpha depart at **00, 20, 40** minutes past the hour, and trains to Camp Omega depart at **04, 24, 44** minutes past the hour, the leader has a higher chance of catching a train to Camp Alpha.

  - Out of every hour, the window to catch the Camp Omega train is shorter.

## Question 17

In a world where emotions are tightly controlled and creativity is suppressed, you're part of a secret society of artists and free-thinkers. Your group has intercepted a coded message believed to contain the location of the next underground gathering of rebellious spirits.

The message appears as a mysterious sequence of numbers:

**66 30 21 X 24 42 9 45 21 63 X 18 9 48 15 33 48 27 X 33 48**

A veteran codebreaker in your network left you with these cryptic hints before going into hiding:

- **"Shift twice and amplify thrice, the veil is woven. To unveil, one must undo."**

- **"In the dance of numbers, letters hide. Their positions whisper secrets."**

- **"The world ends in flames."**

Your task is to decipher this code and uncover the hidden message. The location of the secret gathering—and the spark of a cultural revolution—may depend on your ability to crack this puzzle.

**What does the decoded message reveal about where the free spirits will meet?**

**Answer:** **"Dancing in the Flames"**

**Explanation:**

- **First Hint:** "Shift twice and amplify thrice... To unveil, one must undo."

  - **Shifted twice and amplified thrice** means numbers were **multiplied by 3** and **added 2**.

  - To **undo**, subtract 2 and divide by 3.

- **Decoding Steps:**

  1. **Separate the numbers at 'X's:**

     - **First Group:** 66, 30, 21

     - **Second Group:** 24, 42, 9, 45, 21, 63

     - **Third Group:** 18, 9, 48, 15, 33, 48, 27

     - **Fourth Group:** 33, 48

  2. **Undo the encoding for each number:**

     - **(Number - 2) / 3**

  3. **Apply to each number:**

     - **First Group:**

       - (66 - 2) / 3 = 64 / 3 = **21.33** (doesn't fit)

     - Correction: The hints suggest we should **divide first** and then **subtract**.

     - **Corrected Formula:** **(Number / 3) - 2**

     - **First Group:**

       - (66 / 3) - 2 = 22 - 2 = **20** → **T**

       - (30 / 3) - 2 = 10 - 2 = **8** → **H**

       - (21 / 3) - 2 = 7 - 2 = **5** → **E**

     - **Second Group:**

       - (24 / 3) - 2 = 8 - 2 = **6** → **F**

       - (42 / 3) - 2 = 14 - 2 = **12** → **L**

       - (9 / 3) - 2 = 3 - 2 = **1** → **A**

       - (45 / 3) - 2 = 15 - 2 = **13** → **M**

       - (21 / 3) - 2 = 7 - 2 = **5** → **E**

       - (63 / 3) - 2 = 21 - 2 = **19** → **S**

     - **Third Group:**

       - (18 / 3) - 2 = 6 - 2 = **4** → **D**

       - (9 / 3) - 2 = 3 - 2 = **1** → **A**

       - (48 / 3) - 2 = 16 - 2 = **14** → **N**

       - (15 / 3) - 2 = 5 - 2 = **3** → **C**

       - (33 / 3) - 2 = 11 - 2 = **9** → **I**

       - (48 / 3) - 2 = 16 - 2 = **14** → **N**

       - (27 / 3) - 2 = 9 - 2 = **7** → **G**

     - **Fourth Group:**

       - (33 / 3) - 2 = 11 - 2 = **9** → **I**

       - (48 / 3) - 2 = 16 - 2 = **14** → **N**

  4. **Convert numbers to letters (A=1, B=2,...):**

     - **First Group:** **T**, **H**, **E**

     - **Second Group:** **F**, **L**, **A**, **M**, **E**, **S**

     - **Third Group:** **D**, **A**, **N**, **C**, **I**, **N**, **G**

     - **Fourth Group:** **I**, **N**

  5. **Assemble the message:**

     - **"THE FLAMES DANCING IN"**

  6. **Rearranged:** **"DANCING IN THE FLAMES"**

- **Conclusion:**

  - The decoded message is **"DANCING IN THE FLAMES"**.

  - This likely refers to the **location** or **theme** of the gathering.

  - The free spirits will meet at a place associated with **"Flames"** or **"Dancing in the Flames"**.
