## Question 3

You find yourself in a bleak, dystopian reality where survival hinges on a single choice. Before you stand three rusted, heavy steel doors. Behind one lies the key to escape—a working vehicle that could save your life. Behind the other two, useless scrap. You make your choice, hoping for freedom. But before your fate is sealed, the overseer, who knows what lies behind each door, opens one of the others, revealing nothing but junk. Now, you face a critical decision: stick with your first choice or switch to the last unopened door. In this twisted game of survival, what will give you the best odds of securing the vehicle and escaping?

To maximize your chance of survival, should you stay—or switch?

**Answer:** You should **switch** doors.

**Explanation:**

This is the **Monty Hall problem**. Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of choosing the vehicle. When one scrap door is revealed, switching increases your odds to 2/3.

## Question 4

I am a letter yet a number in disguise,  
Shift me up and down, secrets arise.  
Decode my form, your mission's begun,  
Find the shade and you’ve nearly won.

```
7 14 8 17 7 7 20 7 19 6 7
```

(Convert the numbers to their alphabetical values, subtract 13, then shift back to reveal 'Shade Hunter' using the ROT13 cipher.)

**Answer:** **Shade Hunter**

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1:** Convert numbers to letters (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26):

  ```
  7  → G
  14 → N
  8  → H
  17 → Q
  7  → G
  7  → G
  20 → T
  7  → G
  19 → S
  6  → F
  7  → G
  ```

- **Step 2:** Subtract 13 from each number, wrapping around if necessary:

  ```
  7 -13 = 20 → T
  14-13 = 1  → A
  8 -13 = 21 → U
  17-13 = 4  → D
  ... and so on.
  ```

- **Step 3:** Apply the ROT13 cipher to get 'Shade Hunter'.

## Question 5

In a dystopian world, 100 survivors live in isolation on a barren island, each one with either blue or brown eyes. The harsh law of their society decrees that if anyone realizes they have blue eyes, they must leave at dawn the next morning, never to return. Every survivor knows how many others have blue or brown eyes, but they are cursed with the inability to see their own reflection, leaving them uncertain of their own eye color.

One day, a mysterious outsider arrives, casting a shadow over their fragile existence, and delivers a simple, unsettling message: “At least one of you has blue eyes.” The survivors are thrown into silent turmoil. The knowledge is out, and a countdown begins. How many days will it take for all the blue-eyed survivors to vanish into the wasteland beyond the island’s edge?

**Answer:** **100 days**

**Explanation:**

This is the **Blue-Eyed Islander** puzzle. With 100 blue-eyed people:

- Each blue-eyed person sees 99 others.
- They wait 99 days; when no one leaves, they realize they must also have blue eyes.
- All leave on the 100th day.

## Question 8

In a desolate, dystopian wasteland, a lone camel must transport a precious cargo of 3,000 bananas across 1,000 treacherous miles to reach the last surviving trade hub. The journey is harsh, and the camel can only carry 1,000 bananas at a time. For every mile it travels, the beast consumes a banana as fuel for its survival. The stakes are high, and resources are scarce. Given these brutal conditions, what is the maximum number of bananas the camel can deliver to the distant market without starving along the way?

**Answer:** **533 bananas**

**Explanation:**

The camel must make multiple trips:

- **First 333⅓ miles:**
  - Carrying bananas back and forth, consuming bananas per mile.
- **Next 333⅓ miles:**
  - Fewer trips needed, as fewer bananas remain.
- **Final 333⅓ miles:**
  - Single trip with remaining bananas.

Calculating the losses, the maximum delivery is **533 bananas**.

In the ruins of a fallen world, you possess 12 coins, each seemingly identical, but one of them is a fraud—a subtle forgery, lighter than the rest. The authorities, ruthless and unforgiving, allow you access to a balance scale, but you are only granted three chances to use it. Failure to uncover the counterfeit coin within these weighings could cost you dearly. In this unforgiving wasteland, how many weighings will it take to identify the imposter and secure your survival?

**Answer:** **Three**

**Explanation:**

By dividing and comparing groups strategically in three weighings, you can identify the counterfeit coin among 12 coins.

In a dystopian city ravaged by a deadly virus, a scientist has left behind a journal with a riddle to find the antidote. The journal reads: 'To find the cure, follow the sequence: **3, 7, 15, 31, 63**. What comes next?' Each number is critical to deciphering the antidote’s location.

**Answer:** **127**

**Explanation:**

The sequence follows the pattern:

- Start with **3**.
- Multiply by **2** and add **1** each time:

  ```
  3 × 2 + 1 = 7
  7 × 2 + 1 = 15
  15 × 2 + 1 = 31
  31 × 2 + 1 = 63
  63 × 2 + 1 = **127**
  ```

## Question 16

In the shadowy remnants of a world ruled by oppression, the Resistance communicates through a cipher where each letter is mirrored by its opposite in a reversed alphabet. One such message has surfaced, a series of numbers shrouded in secrecy: **14, 19, 23, 15**.

Whispers suggest this sequence conceals a name, one that could lead to an underground leader or betray a hidden traitor. As the Resistance's survival hangs in the balance, the question arises:

Can you decode these numbers as alphabets to reveal the name that hides in the shadows?

**Answer:** **SNOW** (as in President Snow from *The Hunger Games*)

**Explanation:**

Using standard numbering (A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26):

- 14 → N
- 19 → S
- 23 → W
- 15 → O

Rearranged, the letters spell **SNOW**.

---

## Question 17

In a society fractured by lies and deceit, three weary travelers find refuge in a hotel. They pay $30 for a room, unaware of a hidden discount. The manager, compelled by a rare moment of honesty, realizes the room should only cost $25 and sends $5 back with a corrupt bellboy. But the bellboy, driven by greed, pockets $2 and returns just $1 to each traveler. Now, each traveler has unknowingly paid $9, totaling $27. The bellboy clutches his $2, and yet, the sum only reaches $29.

In a world where trust is shattered and numbers don’t add up, one question remains: What happened to the missing dollar, lost in the shadows of deception?

**Answer:**

There is **no missing dollar**; it's a misdirection.

**Explanation:**

- Travelers paid **$27** total ($9 each).
- **$25** went to the hotel, **$2** to the bellboy.
- The $27 already includes the bellboy's $2.
- Adding the $2 again is incorrect; it should be:

  ```
  $27 (paid by travelers) - $2 (bellboy) = $25 (hotel)
  ```
